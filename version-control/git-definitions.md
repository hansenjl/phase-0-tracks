# Git Definitions

** ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is a way to create many versions of a file so that changes can be tracked. It is useful because it allows you to see what changes were made when and by who. This allows you to find where an error occurred or simply have different versions for different tasks.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a copy of the original folder that allows you to make changes without it affecting the original version. You would use it so that you did not mess up the original version when adding a new feature.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is essentially a save onto the repository. A good commit message includes detailed and specific information about what changes were made.
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict occurs when the changes that have been made cannot be resolved. It occurs when two people are editing the same original file and one person merges with the original file. Then the other person's changed version cannot merge correctly with the original file because it is not the same base original file that they started working from.
